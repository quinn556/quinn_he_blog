I am a graduate student in the Data Analytics and Computational Social Science M.S. program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. My research interests include studying the flow of misinformation on social media, data visualization, and digital behavioral data. I earned my B.A. in English with a certificate in the Study and Practice of Writing, as well as a minor in Psychology from UMass Amherst. My plan for a career is to combine what I\'ve learned in these two unique disciplines and act as a communicator of data for companies.
